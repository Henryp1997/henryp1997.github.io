            ◦ My journey with programming began at Leeds University during my Physics degree. During this degree, Python
                was used for data analysis, plotting and testing of physical models (i.e., through curve fitting to equations
                generated by a particular model). I quickly became interested in Python and software in general.
            <div style="height: 0.5rem;"></div>
            ◦ During my time at Toshiba Europe Ltd, myself and another team member became developers in a self-conceived automation
            project. The aim was to test and optimise QKD systems - before I joined the team this was almost completely manual. This
            automation project contained approximately 20 Python scripts, all designed to optimise one part of the electronics/optics
            contained within the system. This project also contained a front-end so I became familiar with front-end development and
            best-practices. This tool is now the main method of testing the QKD systems and is used by staff unfamiliar with the inner workings of the system.
            <div style="height: 0.5rem;"></div>
            ◦ I explore programming outside of work, including trying other languages - please see below.

            - Began experimenting with 2D platform game physics. Not using any online resources to work out the dynamics of the
            player's movements, aside from the 2D engine (pygame) documentation, as a challenge for myself. This project is in 
            the early stages. Below you can see a screenshot of the demo which currently allows the player to walk and interact with platforms.

            features such as the ability to click cells to 'resurrect' dead cells and start with unique patterns. Below you
            can see a demonstration of the so-called 'Glider gun' pattern.

        <div class="list_item">
            ◦ Automated test - The main focus of the software development at Toshiba Quantum Technology was the automated test of hardware QKD systems. This was my first
                experience	with proper script creation for an app, rather than simple scripts that perform one task. This was a large-scale front and back-end project which
                significantly changed the way systems were tested.
            <div style="height: 0.5rem;"></div>
            ◦ Other work at Toshiba - Many, many scripts were written in Python (as well as Bash) to perform duties such as automated data analysis, plotting and curve-fitting,
                nightly backups of log files from remote Linux servers, and an app for QKD encrypted messaging over a local link.

                packages, I created a program to play the game Pokémon Ruby using a Game Boy Advance emulator and search for a shiny Pokémon. Shiny Pokémon are sprite-recoloured
                Pokémon and have a 1 in 8192 chance to appear over the regular version. This program starts the game and resets if the first Pokémon found (in Professor Birch's
                lab) is not shiny. This required timing the inputs correctly and checking if the sprite was shiny by matching the RGB values of certain pixels to the shiny RGB 
                values. Please see result below, after 7282 resets (corresponding to a 59% chance).

            ◦ Strava activity plotter - Plotting data from all my runs using Strava's API. Written a script to generate the API access code, create the dataframe of all runs and

            ◦ Darts score speech recognition - Writing a script to use speech recognition to record the values hit by each of three darts. This will eventually store all the values
             hit in a large dataframe which will allow analysis of accuracy over time. A histogram will hopefully show the improved accuracy as I continue to practice.

                <a class="github_link" href="https://dash.plotly.com/" target="_blank">Plotly Dash</a>
                which foregoes writing any HTML or JS, allowing someone familiar with Python to create web GUIs. This was the method of GUI creation
                    for my Automation project at Toshiba Quantum Technology. This method still required CSS for styling, however.

            <div style="height: 0.5rem;"></div>
            ◦ To host this website, I had to convert the Dash code into HTML and JS. This wasn't a difficult task and soon I became comfortable adding
                elements using HTML and behaviour using JS.

            ◦ I have experimented with Garmin's SDK for creating apps and watch faces. The programming language, 
            <a class="github_link" href="https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/monkey-c/" target="_blank"> Monkey C</a>, is similar to C++ and Java but

            ◦ As a first project, I decided to make a watch face which shows the time, date and other metrics in what appears to be the __init__ method of
